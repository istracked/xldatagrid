cd xldatagrid
pnpm install
```

### NPM Commands

#### Root-Level Commands (run from repo root)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Start the Kitchen Sink demo (Vite dev server with all features) |
| `pnpm run build` | Build all packages (`core`, `react`, `extensions`, `mui`) with tsup |
| `pnpm test` | Run the full test suite with Vitest |

| `pnpm run docs:open` | Generate API docs and open them in the browser |
| `pnpm run test:e2e` | Run the Playwright end-to-end suite against Storybook (auto-starts Storybook) |
| `pnpm run test:e2e:install` | Install the Chromium browser binary Playwright uses (run once per machine) |
| `pnpm run chromatic` | Upload Storybook to [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) for visual-regression review (requires `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN`) |

### End-to-end tests (Playwright)

The `e2e/` directory contains Playwright specs that drive a real browser
against the Storybook instance:

- `e2e/grid-keyboard.spec.ts` — arrow-key navigation, Enter/Tab commit,
  Escape cancel on an editable text cell.
- `e2e/grid-subgrid.spec.ts` — sub-grid expansion, `aria-labelledby`
  linkage between the nested grid and its parent cell, keyboard
  reachability.
- `e2e/grid-xss.spec.ts` — hostile RichText payloads (raw HTML and
  markdown links) must not produce live `javascript:` hrefs or inline
  event handlers.

#### Running the suite

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run test:e2e:install   # one-off: downloads Chromium
pnpm run test:e2e            # boots Storybook and runs all specs headless
```

The Playwright config spins up `storybook dev -p 6006` as its
`webServer`, so a single `pnpm run test:e2e` invocation is sufficient —
you do not need to pre-start Storybook. When a dev server is already
running locally it is reused instead of a second being spawned.

Useful flags:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --headed              # open a real Chromium window
pnpm exec playwright test --debug               # step-through with the Playwright inspector
pnpm exec playwright test --ui                  # interactive time-travel UI mode
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/grid-keyboard     # target a single spec file
pnpm exec playwright test -g "commits on Enter" # filter by test title (grep)
pnpm exec playwright test --repeat-each=10      # flake hunt by running each test 10×
```

#### Viewing the HTML report

After any run Playwright writes an HTML report to `playwright-report/`.
Open it with:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

This launches a local server (default `http://localhost:9323`) and opens
the report in your browser. The report includes per-test traces, video,
screenshots, network logs, and console output when captured. On CI the
same directory is uploaded as an artifact on failure — download the
`playwright-report` artifact from the failed job and run `show-report`
against the unzipped directory:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report ./playwright-report
```

#### Recording new tests with Claude Code + Playwright MCP

[Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) exposes
Playwright as a Model Context Protocol server so Claude Code can drive
the browser directly — navigating, clicking, typing, reading the
accessibility tree — and emit a ready-to-run spec from what it
observed. Compared to the `codegen` CLI the workflow is
conversational: describe the flow, let the agent exercise it against
a live Storybook, review the generated spec, then commit.

1. Register the MCP server with Claude Code. In the repo root, add a
   `.mcp.json` (checked in) or the project-local override at
   `.claude/settings.json` → `mcpServers`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "playwright": {
         "command": "pnpm",
         "args": ["dlx", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   One-off: the first invocation downloads the Playwright browsers
   under the MCP server's cache. Re-running `pnpm run
   test:e2e:install` afterwards keeps the repo-local cache in sync.

2. Start Storybook so the MCP server has a live target:

   ```bash
   pnpm run storybook
   ```

3. In Claude Code, describe the test you want — for example:

   > Record a Playwright spec that opens
   > `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=basic-grid--default`,
   > tabs into the grid, arrow-navigates to row 3 column 2, and
   > asserts the focused cell's `aria-selected` is `true`. Save it
   > to `e2e/grid-focus.spec.ts`.

   The agent drives the browser through the MCP tools, verifies each
   step against the live DOM, and writes the spec file directly into
   `e2e/`. Selectors are picked from the accessibility tree, so the
   output prefers `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByTestId` by
   default.

4. Run and tighten:

   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright test e2e/grid-focus.spec.ts
   ```

   Iterate in natural language ("prefer `getByRole` over the
   generated CSS", "add an explicit wait for the sub-grid's
   `role=grid` to mount", "replace the hard-coded port with the
   config-relative `page.goto('/iframe.html?id=…')`") until the spec
   is stable on a cold run.

Prefer role-based selectors — they survive layout refactors and
exercise the same a11y wiring `grid-subgrid.spec.ts` relies on.
Replace any absolute `localhost:6006` URLs from the initial recording
with the config-relative `page.goto('/iframe.html?id=…')` so the spec
survives port changes and CI.

#### Recording tests with the Playwright CRX Chrome extension

The [Playwright CRX](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playwright-crx) Chrome
extension is a browser-resident variant of `codegen` that records tests
against pages you open normally — useful when a deploy preview, a remote
staging build, or a live product environment is easier to exercise than
starting Storybook locally, and when you want to click through the same
flow your end users hit.

1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store. Pin it to the
   toolbar so the record button is always visible.
2. Navigate to the page you want to cover. For this repo that is
   typically `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=<story-id>` after
   `pnpm run storybook`, or a deployed Storybook/Chromatic preview URL.
3. Click the Playwright CRX icon, then **Record**. Interact with the page
   exactly as a user would — click cells, press keys, drag handles, open
   menus. The extension panel streams the generated Playwright script in
   real time.
4. When finished, click **Copy** in the panel and paste the generated
   test into a new file under `e2e/` (e.g. `e2e/grid-my-flow.spec.ts`).
   Wrap it in the standard test harness:

   ```ts
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

   test('my recorded flow', async ({ page }) => {
     // paste codegen output here
   });
   ```

5. Run it with `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/grid-my-flow.spec.ts` and
   tighten selectors / assertions by hand where the generator chose
   something brittle (e.g. nth-child CSS). Prefer `getByRole`,
   `getByLabel`, and `getByTestId`.
6. Replace any hard-coded absolute URLs from the recorder with the
   config-relative `page.goto('/iframe.html?id=…')` so the spec survives
   port changes and CI.

Because CRX runs in the same profile as your live browser session, do
not paste cookies, auth tokens, or session storage into committed specs.
Use Playwright storage-state fixtures for anything that needs auth, and
commit only the scripted navigation.

### Visual regression (Chromatic)

`pnpm run chromatic` uploads the full Storybook to Chromatic for
per-story visual diffing. Chromatic runs with `--exit-zero-on-changes`,
so visual changes surface in the Chromatic review UI rather than
blocking the merge.

The corresponding GitHub Actions job is gated behind a repository secret
named `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN`. Configure it under *Settings → Secrets
and variables → Actions → New repository secret*. When the secret is
absent the Chromatic job is skipped with a warning — builds never fail
for missing-token reasons.

### Branch protection

Recommended required checks on `main`:

- `verify-precommit-parity / verify` (existing)
- `E2E + Visual Regression / e2e` (added by this PR)

The `visual` job is intentionally left optional so forks without the
Chromatic token can still pass CI.

### Per-Package Commands

Each package (`core`, `react`, `extensions`, `mui`) exposes the same two scripts:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run build` | Build the package with tsup (outputs ESM + CJS bundles) |
| `pnpm run dev` | Watch mode — rebuild on file changes with tsup |

To run a per-package command from the repo root:

```bash
# Build only the core package
pnpm --filter @istracked/datagrid-core run build

# Watch the react package
pnpm --filter @istracked/datagrid-react run dev
```

### Playground

The playground is a Vite app at `playground/` with the Kitchen Sink demo:

- **Kitchen Sink** (`/kitchen-sink/`) — Single mega-grid with every feature enabled: sorting, filtering, selection, editing, validation, ghost row, context menu, column groups, chrome columns, theming, keyboard navigation, export

### Storybook

17 story files covering every feature:

- Introduction, Basic Grid, Cell Types, Chrome Columns, Column Operations, Context Menu, Editing, Extensions, Filtering, Ghost Row, Grouping, Keyboard Navigation, Kitchen Sink, Master-Detail, Selection, Sorting, Theming

- **Selection** — Cell, row, and range selection modes with keyboard extension (Shift/Ctrl); column/row/all selection; multi-range support
- **Grouping** — Row grouping (single/multi-level) with aggregates (sum, avg, count, min, max) and collapsible column groups
- **Editing** — Inline cell editing with lifecycle management (`beginEdit` / `commitEdit` / `cancelEdit`), validation (sync + regex with error/warning/info severity), and commit/cancel semantics
- **Clipboard** — Copy, cut, and paste integration for single cells and ranges; tab-separated text and HTML table serialization; paste from spreadsheets
- **Undo/Redo** — Command-based undo/redo stack tracking cell edits, row inserts/deletes, row moves, and batch operations; configurable max history (default 100) and auto-batching timeout (300ms)
- **Virtualization** — Row and column virtualization for datasets of 500+ rows with smooth scrolling and configurable overscan
- **Plugin System** — Extension loading and lifecycle orchestration with dependency validation, hook wiring, and reverse-order teardown
- **Event Bus** — Three-phase pub/sub event system (`before` / `on` / `after`) with priority ordering and event cancellation
- **Column Model** — Column definition resolution, width calculation (with min/max clamping), frozen columns (left/right), visibility toggling, reordering, and resizing
- **Transposed Grid** — Form-mode grid where rows are fields and columns are entities

### React Components

- **`<DataGrid>`** — Primary grid component with declarative props for all features
- **`<MasterDetail>`** — Expandable row detail panels with lazy-loading support, single-expand mode, and cache invalidation
- **`<TransposedGrid>`** — Entity-per-column form-mode grid
- **`<GhostRow>`** — Inline new-row entry with position variants (top, bottom, sticky, above-header), default values, and validation
- **Context Menu** — Right-click menu with custom items, submenus, keyboard shortcuts, danger actions, and dividers
- **Keyboard Navigation** — Full arrow-key, Tab, Enter, Escape, Home/End, Page Up/Down navigation with edit-mode entry
- **Theming** — Built-in light and dark themes plus custom CSS variable token maps
- **Chrome Columns** — Optional UI chrome: controls column (far left, action buttons per row) and row-number column (far right, click-to-select, shift/ctrl multi-select, drag-to-reorder)
- **Slots** — Composable slot components: `<Toolbar>`, `<FormulaBar>`, `<StatusBar>`, `<EmptyState>`
- **Drag & Drop** — Row reordering via drag handles on row-number cells

### State Management (Jotai Atoms)

The React package uses a three-tier Jotai atom architecture for granular state:

- **Base Atoms** — Writable ground truth: data, columns, sort, filter, selection, editing, undo/redo, grouping, pagination, config
- **Derived Atoms** — Read-only projections: processed (sorted/filtered) data, visible columns, row IDs
- **Action Atoms** — Write-only mutations: `setCellValue`, `beginEdit`, `commitEdit`, `insertRow`, `deleteRows`, `toggleColumnSort`, etc.

Hooks for consumption:
- `useGrid(config)` — Returns imperative `GridModel`
- `useGridWithAtoms(config)` — Returns `GridModel`, Jotai `store`, and `atoms` for granular subscriptions
- `useGridStore(model)` — Subscribes to full grid state snapshots
- `useGridSelector(model, selector)` — Subscribes to derived state slices
- `useGridContext()` / `useGridAtomContext()` — Access grid from React context

### 15 Cell Types

Each cell type ships as both a standalone React component and an MUI-styled variant:

| Cell Type | Component | MUI Component | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Text | `TextCell` | `MuiTextCell` | Single-line text input (MUI: `TextField` standard variant) |
| Numeric | `NumericCell` | `MuiNumericCell` | Number input with min/max constraints |
| Currency | `CurrencyCell` | `MuiCurrencyCell` | Formatted currency display with locale support |
| Boolean | `CheckboxCell` | `MuiBooleanCell` | Checkbox toggle (MUI: `Checkbox` with indeterminate) |
| Calendar | `CalendarCell` | `MuiCalendarCell` | Date picker |
| Status | `StatusCell` | `MuiStatusCell` | Color-coded status badge with dropdown (MUI: `Select` + `Chip`) |
| List | `ListCell` | `MuiListCell` | Single-select dropdown (MUI: `Select` + `MenuItem`) |
| Password | `PasswordCell` | `MuiPasswordCell` | Masked input with reveal toggle |
| Tags | `TagsCell` | `MuiTagsCell` | Multi-value tag chips with suggestions and free-text entry |
| Chip Select | `ChipSelectCell` | `MuiChipSelectCell` | Multi-select chip picker (MUI: `Autocomplete` multiple) |
| Compound Chip List | `CompoundChipListCell` | `MuiCompoundChipListCell` | Structured chip objects with id/label pairs |
| Rich Text | `RichTextCell` | `MuiRichTextCell` | Bold/italic/formatted text |
| Upload | `UploadCell` | `MuiUploadCell` | File attachment display (MUI: drag-drop with `LinearProgress`) |
| Actions | `ActionsCell` | `MuiActionsCell` | Row-level action buttons (MUI: `Button`) |
| Sub-Grid | `SubGridCell` | `MuiSubGridCell` | Nested grid within a cell |

All cell renderers implement the `CellRendererProps<TData>` interface:

```typescript
interface CellRendererProps<TData> {
  value: CellValue;
  row: TData;
  column: ColumnDef<TData>;
  rowIndex: number;
  isEditing: boolean;
  onCommit: (value: CellValue) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
}
```

### Extensions

| Extension | Factory | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Regex Validation | `createRegexValidation()` | Pattern-based cell validation |
| Cell Comments | `createCellComments()` | Threaded comments on individual cells |
| Column Resize | `createColumnResize()` | Drag-to-resize column headers |
| Export | `createExportExtension()` | CSV, JSON, and Excel export with header/footer customization |

### MUI Theme Bridge

The MUI package bridges your MUI theme to DataGrid CSS variables automatically:

| CSS Variable | MUI Source |
|---|---|
| `--dg-primary-color` | `palette.primary.main` |
| `--dg-bg-color` | `palette.background.paper` |
| `--dg-text-color` | `palette.text.primary` |
| `--dg-border-color` | `palette.divider` |
| `--dg-hover-bg` | `palette.action.hover` |
| `--dg-error-color` | `palette.error.main` |

---

```bash
# Install
pnpm add @istracked/datagrid-core @istracked/datagrid-react

# Or with MUI integration
pnpm add @istracked/datagrid-core @istracked/datagrid-react @istracked/datagrid-mui
```

```tsx
import { DataGrid } from '@istracked/datagrid-react';
import { TextCell } from '@istracked/datagrid-react/cells/TextCell';
import { NumericCell } from '@istracked/datagrid-react/cells/NumericCell';

const columns = [
  { id: 'name', field: 'name', title: 'Name', cellType: 'text', editable: true },
  { id: 'age', field: 'age', title: 'Age', cellType: 'numeric', width: 100 },
];

const data = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
  { id: '2', name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
];

function App() {
  return (
    <DataGrid
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      rowKey="id"
      cellRenderers={{ text: TextCell, numeric: NumericCell }}
      sorting={{ mode: 'multi' }}
      selectionMode="range"
      keyboardNavigation
    />
  );
}
```

### Chrome Columns

Add controls and row numbers to the grid edges:

```tsx
<DataGrid
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowKey="id"
  chrome={{
    controls: {
      width: 80,
      actions: [
        { key: 'edit', label: 'Edit', onClick: (rowId) => console.log('Edit', rowId) },
        { key: 'delete', label: 'Del', onClick: (rowId) => console.log('Delete', rowId) },
      ],
    },
    rowNumbers: { reorderable: true },
  }}
  onRowReorder={({ sourceRowId, targetRowId }) =>
    console.log(`Move ${sourceRowId} to ${targetRowId}`)
  }
/>
```

### Master-Detail

```tsx
import { MasterDetail } from '@istracked/datagrid-react';

<MasterDetail
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowKey="id"
  detailComponent={({ row }) => <div>Details for {row.name}</div>}
  singleExpand        // optional: only one row expanded at a time
  fetchDetail={async (row) => loadDetails(row.id)}  // optional: lazy-load
/>
```

### Ghost Row

```tsx
<DataGrid
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowKey="id"
  ghostRow={{
    position: 'bottom',
    sticky: true,
    placeholder: 'Add new row...',
    defaultValues: { department: 'Engineering' },
    validate: (values) => (!values.name ? 'Name is required' : null),
  }}
  onRowAdd={(row) => console.log('New row:', row)}
/>
```

### Extensions

```tsx
import { createRegexValidation } from '@istracked/datagrid-extensions';
import { createExportExtension } from '@istracked/datagrid-extensions';

// Regex validation on email fields
const emailValidator = createRegexValidation({
  pattern: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
  message: 'Invalid email format',
});

// CSV/JSON export
const exporter = createExportExtension({ format: 'csv' });
```

### MUI Integration

```tsx
import { MuiDataGrid } from '@istracked/datagrid-mui';

// Automatically uses MUI-themed cell renderers and respects your MUI theme
<MuiDataGrid
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  rowKey="id"
  muiTheme={muiTheme}   // optional: bridges MUI theme to grid CSS vars
  sorting
  selectionMode="cell"
/>
```

### Imperative Control via Hooks

```tsx
import { useGrid } from '@istracked/datagrid-react';

function MyGrid() {
  const model = useGrid({ columns, data, rowKey: 'id' });

  // Imperative API
  model.sort([{ field: 'name', dir: 'asc' }]);
  model.filter({ field: 'status', value: 'active' });
  model.setCellValue({ rowId: '1', field: 'name' }, 'Alice');
  model.undo();

  return <DataGrid model={model} />;
}
```

### Fine-Grained Atom Subscriptions

```tsx
import { useGridWithAtoms } from '@istracked/datagrid-react';

function MyGrid() {
  const { model, store, atoms } = useGridWithAtoms(config);

  // Read derived state
  const sortState = store.get(atoms.base.sortAtom);
  const processedData = store.get(atoms.derived.processedDataAtom);

  return <DataGrid model={model} />;
}
```

const myExtension: ExtensionDefinition = {
  id: 'my-extension',
  name: 'My Extension',
  version: '1.0.0',
  dependencies: [],             // other extension IDs
  init: (ctx) => {              // called on load
    const state = ctx.gridState;
    ctx.commands.setCellValue({ rowId: '1', field: 'name' }, 'Hello');
  },
  destroy: (ctx) => { },       // called on teardown (LIFO order)
  hooks: (ctx) => [
    {
      event: 'cell:valueChange',
      phase: 'after',           // 'before' | 'on' | 'after'
      priority: 500,            // lower runs first
