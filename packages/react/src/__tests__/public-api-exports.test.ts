/**
 * Guard test that pins the `@istracked/datagrid-react` public API contract
 * for the cell-editor hooks consumed by `@istracked/datagrid-mui`.
 *
 * The three named exports asserted below (`useDraftState`, `useSelectState`,
 * `useArrayState`) back every built-in and third-party cell renderer; moving
 * them to a sub-path export or renaming them would silently break the MUI
 * cell package (see the WS-C baseline typecheck regression). This suite is
 * deliberately loud so the contract can only change by editing this file.
