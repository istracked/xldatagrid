/**
 * Context-menu overlay for the datagrid.
 *
 * Renders a floating menu triggered by right-click on rows or column headers.
 * Supports nested sub-menus (via `children` on menu items), keyboard dismiss
 * (Escape), outside-click dismiss, and viewport-boundary repositioning so the
 * menu never overflows the screen.
 *
 * ## The problem this module solves
 *
 * A datagrid is frequently embedded inside containers that apply CSS
 * `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective` — virtualized scroll wrappers,
 * animated modals, drag overlays, `will-change` optimizations, and so on.
 * Per the CSS spec, any of those properties turns the ancestor into the
 * containing block for descendants with `position: fixed`. The menu that
 * logically "should" appear at the cursor then resolves its `top`/`left`
 * relative to the transformed ancestor's origin instead of the viewport,
 * so it visually lands far from the click — typically hugging the far
 * left of the window.
 *
 * Two structural choices prevent that:
 *
 * 1. **Portal to `document.body`.** The menu DOM node is re-parented under
 *    `document.body` via `createPortal`, so no transformed ancestor sits
 *    between it and the viewport. `position: fixed` then resolves against
 *    the viewport as intended. Any future refactor that inlines the menu
 *    back into the grid subtree will regress this bug — hence the
 *    regression tests guarding the portal invariant.
 *
 * 2. **Re-seed position from `state.x/y` inside a layout effect.** The
 *    initial `useState({ x: state.x, y: state.y })` call captures the
 *    coordinates at mount time, which — because the component is kept
 *    mounted across opens — is the default `(0, 0)`. Each subsequent
 *    right-click feeds new coordinates through `state`, and the layout
 *    effect overwrites the local `position` state from those fresh
 *    coordinates before the browser paints. Doing this in
 *    `useLayoutEffect` (rather than `useEffect`) guarantees the menu
 *    never flashes at the stale `(0, 0)` during the first committed
 *    frame after opening.
 *
 * ## Viewport-edge avoidance
 *
 * After the menu mounts, the layout effect reads the rendered node's
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` and compares it against `window.innerWidth /
 * innerHeight`. If the menu would overflow the right or bottom edge, the
 * anchor is pulled back just enough to keep it fully visible; negative
 * coordinates are clamped to zero. This happens synchronously before
 * paint, so the user never sees the clipped state.
 *
 * ## Submenu positioning rules
 *
 * Sub-menus are rendered as descendants of their parent `<div>` entry and
 * positioned with plain absolute CSS defined in `ContextMenu.styles`. They
 * open on mouse-enter and close on mouse-leave with a short debounce to
 * tolerate diagonal pointer travel across the arrow gap. They inherit the
 * top-level menu's portal indirectly (everything below the top-level menu
 * is inside `document.body`), so they do not need their own portal.
 *
