 * Hooks are executed in deterministic order: first by phase (`before` → `on`
 * → `after`), then by ascending priority within each phase. A `before`-phase
 * handler may cancel the event by returning `false`, which prevents all
 * `on`-phase handlers from running while still allowing `after`-phase
 * handlers to execute (useful for logging, analytics, and cleanup).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const bus = new EventBus();
 *
 * const removeHook = bus.addHook({
 *   event: 'cell:valueChange',
 *   phase: 'before',
 *   handler: (e) => {
 *     if (!isValid(e.payload)) return false; // cancels the event
 *   },
 * });
 *
 * await bus.dispatch('cell:valueChange', { rowId: '1', field: 'name', value: 'Alice' });
 * removeHook(); // unsubscribe when done
 * ```
