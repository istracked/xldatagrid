/**
 * Public entry point for the `@datagrid/core` package.
 *
 * This barrel is the single import surface consumed by downstream packages
 * (notably `@istracked/datagrid-react`) and by application code embedding the
 * grid directly. It stitches together the framework-agnostic building blocks
 * of the data grid — state containers, selection and sort engines, the plugin
 * host, and the persisted search-index primitives — so that every public
 * symbol from any sub-module is reachable from a single import path:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { EventBus, GridConfig, ColumnDef } from '@datagrid/core';
 * ```
 *
 * The re-export order is intentionally bottom-up: leaf types first, then
 * feature modules that depend on them, then cross-cutting subsystems like
 * plugins and undo/redo that observe the rest.
 *
 * Modules re-exported:
 * - **types** — shared interfaces, type aliases, and enumerations.
 * - **events** — the {@link EventBus} publish/subscribe implementation.
 * - **grid-model** — core grid state management.
 * - **column-model** — column definition resolution and helpers.
 * - **selection** — cell/range selection logic.
 * - **sorting** — sort-state management and comparators.
 * - **filtering** — filter predicate evaluation.
 * - **virtualization** — row/column virtualisation for large datasets.
 * - **editing** — cell editing lifecycle management.
 * - **clipboard** — copy/paste integration.
 * - **grouping** — row and column grouping engine.
 * - **plugin** — extension loading and lifecycle orchestration.
 * - **undo-redo** — command-based undo/redo stack.
 * - **transposed** — form-mode (field-per-row) grid configuration helpers.
 * - **search-index** — prefix trie, column-index builders, and IDB adapter.
